# Easy Translator

A script to convert the .xliff to .csv file and convert it back. If you want to send .csv file to other people for easier traslation, you can use this swift script. 

## Plans

Currently the script is not yet finished, its still work in progress. Here is what I plan to do

1. Convert from Xcode exported .xliff to .csv
2. Convert .csv back to .xliff and able to import into Xcode

In future I might want to add Android support

1. Convert Android String .xml file exported to .csv
2. Able to combine both .csv exported from Android and iOS into one .csv (Remove duplicates)
3. Convert .csv back to .xml and able to use back in Android Studio.
